# User Role Management for Gravity Forms
A Wordpress plugin that adds an admin-only UI to grant specific Gravity Forms permissions (view, edit, create, export, etc.) to existing roles that already have wp-admin access, while keeping administrators’ access intact and blocking non-admin users from managing these settings.
